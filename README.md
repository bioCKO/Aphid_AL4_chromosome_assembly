# The analytical pipeline of the AL4 strain genome
This document is a walkthrough of the methods and code used to analyze the chromosome-level pea aphid genome assembly (AL4 assembly). In the aphid paper, we used HiC and Chicago library to build the chromosome-level assembly and analyzed gene family evolution on the chromosome. We also sequenced seven A. pisum individuals for detecting X chromosome, carotenoid gene and wing-dimorphism related sequence variations.
