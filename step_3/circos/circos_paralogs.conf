# 1.2 IDEOGRAM LABELS, TICKS, AND MODULARIZING CONFIGURATION
#
# In this tutorial, I will add tick marks, tick labels and ideogram
# labels to the previous image. This will require the use of a <ticks>
# block and expanding the <ideogram> block. 
#
# To make the configuration more modular, the tick and ideogram
# parameters will be stored in different files and imported using the
# <<include>> directive.
karyotype = karyotype.aphid.color.rename.txt
radius = 0.50r
#karyotype = karyotype.aphid.txt

# The chromosomes_unit value is used as a unit (suffix "u") to shorten
# values in other parts of the configuration file. Some parameters,
# such as ideogram and tick spacing, accept "u" suffixes, so instead of
#
# spacing = 10000000
#
# you can write
#
# spacing = 10u
#
# See ticks.conf for examples.

chromosomes_units = 1000000

# The track is confined within r0/r1 radius limits. When using the
# relative "r" suffix, the values are relative to the position of the
# ideogram.

r0   = 0.72r

# Histograms can have both a fill and outline. The default outline is 1px thick black.

# Like for links, rules are used to dynamically alter formatting of
# each data point (i.e. histogram bin). Here, I include the <rule>
# block from a file, which contains the following
#
# <rule>
# condition = on(hs1)
# show      = no
# </rule>
#
# to avoid displaying any data on hs1. The rule is included from a
# file because it is reused again in the track below.

#<rules>
#<<include rule.exclude.hs1.conf>>
#</rules>

# Below I define another histogram. This will be a stacked histogram,
# which will show several values for a given position by stacking
# bins. This is a special kind of 2D data track which uses the data
# format
#
# #chr start end value,value,value,... [options]
# ...
# hs3 196000000 197999999 0.0000,7.0000,64.0000,0.0000
# hs3 198000000 199999999 21.0000,6.0000,18.0000,12.0000
# hs4 0 1999999 5.0000,3.0000,1.0000,19.0000

# hs4 4000000 5999999 1.0000,13.0000,25.0000,20.0000

# Circos will automatically format the track as a stacked histogram
# when type=histogram and multiple values in the data file are found.
